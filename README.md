## Description

The MSMS (Movie Streaming Management Service) is an Android Studio app written in Java and tested with Junit. It was a collaborative project for the University of Manitoba's (Undergrad) Software Engineering course and was designed to manage a database of movies. There are four main architectural layers: "presentation" (UI), "business" (logic), "persistence" (database), and objects. I (Michael) primarily focused on the presentation layer; this involved designing the UI, handling and scrubbing user inputs, and facilitating communication with the business layer.
